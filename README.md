**COPI - Chronological Order Preparation of Images**

The aim of this project is to provide a graphical tool helping users to sort their images (taken from different unsynchronized sources) by preparing a chronological order (timeshifting the exif-information and renaming).

All images coming from a certain device (by specifying a source directory) are rendered (using OpenGl) on a timeline that can be shifted towards the other timelines. When all timelines are properly justified all images with the differences obtained by the shifts are written to the specified target directory with an updated exif time and a time-formatted filename. 

For further information concerning dependencies and how to build COPI see the Wiki.
